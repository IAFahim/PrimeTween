After cloning the repo, open the '*Window/General/**Test Runner***' and run the tests on the target platform by pressing the '*Run All Tests (TargetPlatform)*' button.

This repo has the `PRIME_TWEEN_DISABLE_ASSERTIONS` define. PrimeTween heavily uses assertions in development builds, and this define will disable them to match the release performance in tests.
